    <p>Winward Natural Equine Center is owned and operated by Walter W. Winward & Sandyjean Winward.  While Walter (aka Jimmy Cole) is a retired broadcaster, the real "horse whisperer,” trainer, and (pardon the inference) “workhorse” is Sandyjean, who has been working around horses for more years than she will allow me to publish.  Sandyjean has been here at this location over forty years.

It is important to know of Sandyjean’s philsophy of training all riders with their own horse, which is why we also offer spacious stalls with paddocks for boarding your horse here.

Our feeding program is done with on-site live-on personnel Dean, and our partners Andy and Celina Root also live on-site and do maintenance, horse turn-outs, and many other things to keep us running smoothly.  We have trainer Sierra Backman, an unusually-talented young woman, available for training and lessons. (see her pix & contact info within)<br>For twenty years, Walt and Sandyjean bred and showed arabian horses, earning the stallion Luzonabor+ the Legion of Honor award.  During this same time they showed Western Pleasure, English Pleasure, Driving, Halter, and Sandyjean’s favorite, Native Costume.

Taking that experience and combining it with Natural Horsemanship put us in a position to be able to help you and your horse with whatever you need.</br>
