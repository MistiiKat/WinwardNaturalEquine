    <p>WINWARD  NATURAL  EQUINE  CENTER  is Owned & Operated by Walter W. Winward & Sandyjean Winward.  While Walter (aka Jimmy Cole) is a retired broadcaster, the “Real Horse Whisperer”, Trainer & (pardon the inference) “WorkHorse” is, Sandyjean, who has been working around horses for more years than she will allow me to publish.  Sandyjean has been here at this location for forty + years.

It is important to know of Sandyjean’s philsophy of training all riders with their own horse, which is why we also offer spacious stalls with paddocks for boarding your horse here.

Our feeding program is done with on-site live-on personnel (“Dean”), and our partners Andy & Celina Root also live on-site, & do maintenance, horse turn-outs, & many other things to keep us running smoothly.  We have Trainer Sierra Backman, an unusually-talented young woman, available for training & lessons. (see her pix & contact info within)</p></div>
